# calculator

A simple calculator written in C programming language (it's a C-alculator xD).

## How it Works

The calculator receives an infix expression, passed as an argument on the command line, then converts it to a postfix expression and performs the calculation. It uses structs like queues and stacks to perform conversion and calculation.

## How to Use

Just compile and type in your favorite terminal the following command line `./program infix_expression`, for example `./calculator 2*3+12/4`, and the result will come next, in this case, `9` is returned.

> **Tip:** It's a simple calculator, so use simple expressions, only natural numbers and forget about parentheses.
